Write an ARM assembly program that will evaluate the followingexpression, placing the result in register 0:




r0 = ((-C + D) * (F â€“ E)^2) / 16




Your program must use the following data definitions:




C DCD 234

D DCD 401

E DCD 9

F DCD 100




You will need to use the LDR instruction to load C, D, E and F intoregisters. You will need to use LSR to simulate division by 16. Use ahexadecimal calculator to verify that your result is correct. Be sure tocomment your program well. Submit your .s file (that is the filecontaining your source code) through Canvas.
